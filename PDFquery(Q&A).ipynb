YouTube Channel\\n(https://www .youtube.com/channel/UCmOwsoHty5PrmE-3QhUBfPQ)\\nBlog (/) About (/about)\\nThe Illustrated T ransformer\\nIn the previous post, we looked at Attention  (https://jalammar .github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-\\nmechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/)  – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models. Attention is a\\nconcept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at\\nThe T ransformer  – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The\\nTransformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit,\\nhowever , comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’ s recommendation\\nto use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU (https://cloud.google.com/tpu/)  offering. So let’ s\\ntry to break the model apart and look at how it functions.\\nThe Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need  (https://arxiv .org/abs/1706.03762) . A TensorFlow\\nimplementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2T ensor  (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor)  package.\\nHarvard’ s NLP  group created a guide annotating the paper with PyT orch implementation\\n(http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) . In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and\\nintroduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of\\nthe subject matter .\\n2020 Update : I’ve created a “Narrated Transformer” video which is a gentler approach to the topic:\\nThe Narr ated Transformer Language Model The Narr ated Transformer Language Model\\nA High-Level Look\\nLet’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a\\nsentence in one language, and output its translation in another .\\nDiscussions: Hacker News (65 points, 4 comments)  (https://news.ycombinator .com/item?id=18351674) , Reddit r/MachineLearning (29 points, 3 comments)\\n(https://www .reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8uh2yz/p_the_illustrated_transformer_a_visual_look_at/)\\nTranslations: Arabic  (https://www .mundhor .site/post/post14) , Chinese (Simplified) 1  (https://blog.csdn.net/yujianmin1990/article/details/85221271) , Chinese\\n(Simplified) 2  (https://blog.csdn.net/qq_36667170/article/details/124359818) , French 1  (https://a-coles.github.io/2020/1 1/15/transformer-illustre.html) , French\\n2 (https://lbourdois.github.io/blog/nlp/T ransformer/) , Italian  (https://medium.com/@val.mannucci/il-transformer-illustrato-it-37a78e3e2348) , Japanese\\n(https://tips-memo.com/translation-jayalmmar-transformer) , Korean  (https://nlpinkorean.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) , Persian\\n(http://dml.qom.ac.ir/2022/05/17/illustrated-transformer/) , Russian  (https://habr .com/ru/post/486358/) , Spanish 1\\n(https://www .ibidemgroup.com/edu/transformer-ilustrado-jay-alammar/) , Spanish 2  (https://hackernoon.com/el-transformador-ilustrado-una-traduccion-al-\\nespanol-0y73wwp) , Vietnamese  (https://trituenhantao.io/tin-tuc/minh-hoa-transformer/)\\nWatch: MIT’ s Deep Learning State of the Art (https://youtu.be/53Y vP6gdD7U?t=432)  lecture referencing this postPopping open that Optimus Prime goodness, we see an encoding component, a decoding component, and\\nconnections between them.\\nThe encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other – there’ s nothing\\nmagical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a\\nstack of decoders of the same number .\\nThe encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-\\nlayers:\\nThe encoder ’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the\\ninput sentence as it encodes a specific word. W e’ll look closer at self-attention later in the post.\\nThe outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network\\nis independently applied to each position.\\nThe decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant\\nparts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in seq2seq models  (https://jalammar .github.io/visualizing-\\nneural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) ).\\nBringing The T ensors Into The Picture\\nNow that we’ve seen the major components of the model, let’ s start to look at the various vectors/tensors and how\\nthey flow between these components to turn the input of a trained model into an output.\\nAs is the case in NLP  applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an embedding\\nalgorithm  (https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca) .\\nEach word is embedded into a vector of size 512. We\\'ll represent those vectors with these simple boxes.\\nThe embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder . The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that\\nthey receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in\\nother encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’ s directly below . The size of this list is hyperparameter we\\ncan set – basically it would be the length of the longest sentence in our training dataset.\\nAfter embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder .Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer , which is that the word in each position flows through its\\nown path in the encoder . There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer . The feed-forward\\nlayer does not have those dependencies, however , and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while\\nflowing through the feed-forward layer .\\nNext, we’ll switch up the example to a shorter sentence and we’ll look at what happens in each sub-layer of the\\nencoder .\\nNow W e’re Encoding!\\nAs we’ve mentioned already , an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these\\nvectors into a ‘self-attention’  layer , then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the\\nnext encoder .\\nThe word at each position passes through a self-attention process. Then, they each pass through a feed-forward neural network -- theexact same network with each vector flowing through it separately.\\nSelf-Attention at a High Level\\nDon’t be fooled by me throwing around the word “self-attention” like it’ s a concept everyone should be familiar with. I\\nhad personally never came across the concept until reading the Attention is All You Need paper . Let us distill how it\\nworks.\\nSay the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:\\n”The animal didn\\'t cross the street because it was too tired ”\\nWhat does “it” in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’ s a simple question to a human,\\nbut not as simple to an algorithm.\\nWhen the model is processing the word “it”, self-attention allows it to associate “it” with “animal”.\\nAs the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other\\npositions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word.\\nIf you’re familiar with RNNs, think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation\\nof previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it’ s processing. Self-attention is the method the\\nTransformer uses to bake the “understanding” of other relevant words into the one we’re currently processing.\\nAs we are encoding the word \"it\" in encoder #5 (the top encoder in the stack), part of the attention mechanism was focusing on \"The\\nAnimal\", and baked a part of its representation into the encoding of \"it\".\\nBe sure to check out the Tensor2T ensor notebook\\n(https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/notebooks/hello_t2t.ipynb)\\nwhere you can load a Transformer model, and examine it using this interactive visualization.\\nSelf-Attention in Detail\\nLet’s first look at how to calculate self-attention using vectors, then proceed to look at how it’ s actually implemented –\\nusing matrices.\\nThe first step  in calculating self-attention is to create three vectors from each of the encoder ’s input vectors (in this\\ncase, the embedding of each word). So for each word, we create a Query vector , a Key vector , and a V alue vector .\\nThese vectors are created by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process.\\nNotice that these new vectors are smaller in dimension than the embedding vector . Their dimensionality is 64, while\\nthe embedding and encoder input/output vectors have dimensionality of 512. They don’t HA VE to be smaller , this is an\\narchitecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant.Multiplying x1 by the WQ weight matrix produces q1, the \"query\" vector associated with that word. We end up creating a \"query\", a \"key\",\\nand a \"value\" projection of each word in the input sentence.\\nWhat are the “query”, “key”, and “value” vectors?\\nThey’re abstractions that are useful for calculating and thinking about attention. Once you proceed with reading how\\nattention is calculated below , you’ll know pretty much all you need to know about the role each of these vectors plays.\\nThe second step  in calculating self-attention is to calculate a score. Say we’re calculating the self-attention for the\\nfirst word in this example, “Thinking”. W e need to score each word of the input sentence against this word. The score\\ndetermines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position.\\nThe score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query vector  with the key vector  of the respective word we’re\\nscoring. So if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of\\nq1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2.\\nThe third and fourth steps  are to divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in\\nthe paper – 64. This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the\\ndefault), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and\\nadd up to 1.This softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this\\nposition will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’ s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the\\ncurrent word.\\nThe fifth step  is to multiply each value vector by the softmax score (in preparation to sum them up). The intuition here\\nis to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by\\ntiny numbers like 0.001, for example).\\nThe sixth step  is to sum up the weighted value vectors. This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this\\nposition (for the first word).That concludes the self-attention calculation. The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural\\nnetwork. In the actual implementation, however , this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. So let’ s\\nlook at that now that we’ve seen the intuition of the calculation on the word level.\\nMatrix Calculation of Self-Attention\\nThe first step  is to calculate the Query , Key , and V alue matrices. W e do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix\\nX, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained ( WQ, WK, WV).Every row in the X matrix corresponds to a word in the input sentence. We again see the difference in size of the embedding vector (512,\\nor 4 boxes in the figure), and the q/k/v vectors (64, or 3 boxes in the figure)\\nFinally , since we’re dealing with matrices, we can condense steps two through six in one formula to calculate the\\noutputs of the self-attention layer .\\nThe self-attention calculation in matrix form\\nThe Beast W ith Many Heads\\nThe paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This\\nimproves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:\\n1. It expands the model’ s ability to focus on dif ferent positions. Yes, in the example above, z1 contains a little bit of\\nevery other encoding, but it could be dominated by the actual word itself. If we’re translating a sentence like “The\\nanimal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to.2. It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we\\nhave not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/V alue weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention\\nheads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then,\\nafter training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a\\ndifferent representation subspace.\\nWith multi-headed attention, we maintain separate Q/K/V weight matrices for each head resulting in different Q/K/V matrices. As we did\\nbefore, we multiply X by the WQ/WK/WV matrices to produce Q/K/V matrices.\\nIf we do the same self-attention calculation we outlined above, just eight dif ferent times with dif ferent weight matrices,\\nwe end up with eight dif ferent Z matrices\\nThis leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’ s expecting a single\\nmatrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.\\nHow do we do that? W e concat the matrices then multiply them by an additional weights matrix WO.That’ s pretty much all there is to multi-headed self-attention. It’ s quite a handful of matrices, I realize. Let me try to put\\nthem all in one visual so we can look at them in one place\\nNow that we have touched upon attention heads, let’ s revisit our example from before to see where the dif ferent\\nattention heads are focusing as we encode the word “it” in our example sentence:As we encode the word \"it\", one attention head is focusing most on \"the animal\", while another is focusing on \"tired\" -- in a sense, the\\nmodel\\'s representation of the word \"it\" bakes in some of the representation of both \"animal\" and \"tired\".\\nIf we add all the attention heads to the picture, however , things can be harder to interpret:\\nRepresenting The Order of The Sequence Using Positional Encoding\\nOne thing that’ s missing from the model as we have described it so far is a way to account for the order of the words\\nin the input sequence.\\nTo address this, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding. These vectors follow a specific pattern that\\nthe model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between dif ferent words in the\\nsequence. The intuition here is that adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between\\nthe embedding vectors once they’re projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention.To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors -- the values of which follow a specific pattern.\\nIf we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:\\nA real example of positional encoding with a toy embedding size of 4\\nWhat might this pattern look like?\\nIn the following figure, each row corresponds to a positional encoding of a vector . So the first row would be the vector\\nwe’d add to the embedding of the first word in an input sequence. Each row contains 512 values – each with a value\\nbetween 1 and -1. W e’ve color-coded them so the pattern is visible.A real example of positional encoding for 20 words (rows) with an embedding size of 512 (columns). You can see that it appears split in\\nhalf down the center. That\\'s because the values of the left half are generated by one function (which uses sine), and the right half is\\ngenerated by another function (which uses cosine). They\\'re then concatenated to form each of the positional encoding vectors.\\nThe formula for positional encoding is described in the paper (section 3.5). You can see the code for generating\\npositional encodings in get_timing_signal_1d()\\n(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/23bd23b9830059fbc349381b70d9429b5c40a139/tensor2tensor/layers/comm\\nThis is not the only possible method for positional encoding. It, however , gives the advantage of being able to scale to\\nunseen lengths of sequences (e.g. if our trained model is asked to translate a sentence longer than any of those in\\nour training set).\\nJuly 2020 Update:  The positional encoding shown above is from the Tensor2T ensor implementation of the\\nTransformer . The method shown in the paper is slightly dif ferent in that it doesn’t directly concatenate, but interweaves\\nthe two signals. The following figure shows what that looks like. Here’ s the code to generate it\\n(https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar .github.io/blob/master/notebookes/transformer/transformer_positional_encoding_graph.ip\\nThe Residuals\\nOne detail in the architecture of the encoder that we need to mention before moving on, is that each sub-layer (self-\\nattention, f fnn) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a layer-normalization\\n(https://arxiv .org/abs/1607.06450)  step.\\nIf we’re to visualize the vectors and the layer-norm operation associated with self attention, it would look like this:\\nThis goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well. If we’re to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and\\ndecoders, it would look something like this:The Decoder Side\\nNow that we’ve covered most of the concepts on the encoder side, we basically know how the components of\\ndecoders work as well. But let’ s take a look at how they work together .\\nThe encoder start by processing the input sequence. The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of\\nattention vectors K and V . These are to be used by each decoder in its “encoder-decoder attention” layer which helps\\nthe decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence:\\nAfter finishing the encoding phase, we begin the decoding phase. Each step in the decoding phase outputs an element from the output\\nsequence (the English translation sentence in this case).\\nThe following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has\\ncompleted its output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoders\\nbubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. And just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and\\nadd positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.The self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly dif ferent way than the one in the encoder:\\nIn the decoder , the self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is\\ndone by masking future positions (setting them to -inf ) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.\\nThe “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix\\nfrom the layer below it, and takes the Keys and V alues matrix from the output of the encoder stack.\\nThe Final Linear and Softmax Layer\\nThe decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. How do we turn that into a word? That’ s the job of the final Linear layer\\nwhich is followed by a Softmax Layer .\\nThe Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of\\ndecoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector .\\nLet’s assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model’ s “output vocabulary”) that it’ s learned\\nfrom its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide – each cell corresponding to the score of\\na unique word. That is how we interpret the output of the model followed by the Linear layer .\\nThe softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest\\nprobability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step.This figure starts from the bottom with the vector produced as the output of the decoder stack. It is then turned into an output word.\\nRecap Of T raining\\nNow that we’ve covered the entire forward-pass process through a trained Transformer , it would be useful to glance at\\nthe intuition of training the model.\\nDuring training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. But since we are training it on a\\nlabeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.\\nTo visualize this, let’ s assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(“a”, “am”, “i”, “thanks”, “student”, and\\n“<eos>” (short for ‘end of sentence’)).\\nThe output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we\\neven begin training.\\nOnce we define our output vocabulary , we can use a vector of the same width to indicate each word in our vocabulary .\\nThis also known as one-hot encoding. So for example, we can indicate the word “am” using the following vector:\\nExample: one-hot encoding of our output vocabularyFollowing this recap, let’ s discuss the model’ s loss function – the metric we are optimizing during the training phase to\\nlead up to a trained and hopefully amazingly accurate model.\\nThe Loss Function\\nSay we are training our model. Say it’ s our first step in the training phase, and we’re training it on a simple example –\\ntranslating “merci” into “thanks”.\\nWhat this means, is that we want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word “thanks”. But since this\\nmodel is not yet trained, that’ s unlikely to happen just yet.\\nSince the model\\'s parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained)\\nmodel produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can\\ncompare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model\\'s weights using\\nbackpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output.\\nHow do you compare two probability distributions? W e simply subtract one from the other . For more details, look at\\ncross-entropy  (https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-V isual-Information/)  and Kullback–Leibler divergence\\n(https://www .countbayesie.com/blog/2017/5/9/kullback-leibler-divergence-explained) .\\nBut note that this is an oversimplified example. More realistically , we’ll use a sentence longer than one word. For\\nexample – input: “je suis étudiant” and expected output: “i am a student”. What this really means, is that we want our\\nmodel to successively output probability distributions where:\\nEach probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more\\nrealistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)\\nThe first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “i”\\nThe second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word “am”\\nAnd so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‘ <end of sentence> ’ symbol, which also has a cell\\nassociated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary .The targeted probability distributions we\\'ll train our model against in the training example\\nfor one sample sentence.\\nAfter training the model for enough time on a large enough dataset, we would hope the produced probability\\ndistributions would look like this:\\nHopefully upon training, the model would output the right translation we expect. Of\\ncourse it\\'s no real indication if this phrase was part of the training dataset (see: cross\\nvalidation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIgfjmp-4BA)). Notice that every position\\ngets a little bit of probability even if it\\'s unlikely to be the output of that time step -- that\\'s\\na very useful property of softmax which helps the training process.\\nNow, because the model produces the outputs one at a time, we can assume that the model is selecting the word with\\nthe highest probability from that probability distribution and throwing away the rest. That’ s one way to do it (called\\ngreedy decoding). Another way to do it would be to hold on to, say , the top two words (say , ‘I’ and ‘a’  for example),\\nthen in the next step, run the model twice: once assuming the first output position was the word ‘I’, and another time\\nassuming the first output position was the word ‘a’, and whichever version produced less error considering both\\npositions #1 and #2 is kept. W e repeat this for positions #2 and #3…etc. This method is called “beam search”, where\\nin our example, beam_size was two (meaning that at all times, two partial hypotheses (unfinished translations) are\\nkept in memory), and top_beams is also two (meaning we’ll return two translations). These are both hyperparameters\\nthat you can experiment with.Go Forth And T ransform\\nI hope you’ve found this a useful place to start to break the ice with the major concepts of the Transformer .
